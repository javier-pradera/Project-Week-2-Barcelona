## Project Description
This project consists of the analyisis of Barcelona’s population main variables (births, deaths, immigration and emigration) by neighborhood and their relationship with the revenue levels.

## Questions & Hypotheses
The main question to be answered with our analysis is the distribution of population, deaths, births, immigration and emigration based on the neighborhoods’ revenue levels.

## Dataset
The original datasets are located in the “Sources folder” (link Github) and consist of the following:
- **External sources**:
    - **name.csv**: description
- **Sources provided by Ironhack**:
    - **population.csv**: detail of the population by neighborhood and age group.
    - 

## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other? Include a drawing or computer-generated image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of your database.

## Workflow
Our workflow consisted of the following:
- **Definition of the project’s goal:** definition of the above-mentioned main question of the project.
- **Datasets research**: we then completed the provided information with the external datasets mentioned before.
- **Data cleaning and validation**: preparation of the datasets for their analysis and cross-check of the main total values.
- **Analysis of the data**: we divided our analysis into three main topics: deaths, immigration and emigration, and births.
- **Results presentation**: we finally cleaned our code and repository for the presentation, elaborated the README file and prepared the visual support.
